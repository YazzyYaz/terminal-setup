# Terminal Development Environment Setup

This document is to provide a guidance for a preferred development environment 
in the command line with the chosen themes, shell profiles and Vim setup. This 
is due to having to reconfigure the same setup on multiple laptops when my 
computer was being fixed, so having it all in one place as a guide made the 
most sense.


## Font

The main font to be used for development in Terminal will be: `Victor Mono`
Information about it can be found [here](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)

Installation process:
```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-victor-mono
```

## iTerm2 Theme

The iTerm2 Theme to be used will be `Lovelace`. A `lovelace.itermcolors` file
is part of this repository.

## Shell Profile

The Shell Profile to use will be ZSH. It should be installed with Oh-My-Zsh included.
Oh-My-Zsh profile to be used will be `agnoster`.
